## Introduction

This script performs a dot product between input values and weights to simulate the behavior of neurons in a layer of a neural network. The result is further adjusted by adding biases to simulate neuron activation. This forms the basis of forward propagation in neural networks.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure to install the required packages. The dependencies are managed in the `requirement.py` file.

To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.py
